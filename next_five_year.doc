ABIOLAâ€™S VISION FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS

My name is Abiola Lamidi, an aspiring Nurse who turned out to become a Software Quality Assurance Engineer. In the last eight years, I have been able to acquire in-depth knowledge on Manual Software Testing, within this period I was able to train five aspiring Tech women, followed up with them getting a Software Testing job. I have been able to acquaint myself with proper Business Requirement Documentation, Software patches, Change requests, User acceptance test scripts among others.
I have had engagements with Business Analysts, Software Developers, Project Managers, Business Owners, and quite number of stakeholders which has helped me gain strong understanding of the technical aspect of software development from its planning stage to the Deployment Stage
In the nearest years to come, I will love to see myself as a FULL STACK Software Test Automation Expert where I can automate web and mobile applications in order to eliminate the manual method of testing and delivering applications. Also on my future list is a security tester where I will be able to develop effective security strategies to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities in  software systems.
